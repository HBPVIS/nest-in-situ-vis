## Overview

*nest in situ vis* (`niv`) is (the yet prototypical implementation of) a library facilitating in situ visualization for the [nest simulator](http://www.nest-simulator.org).

With `niv` data can be collected in nest's recording backends and transported to a visualization process. Currently, only on-node transport to a separate visualization process is provided using shared memory.


## Building


### Requirements

* a customized nest simulator with nestio and a conduit recording backend
* [conduit 0.2.1](https://github.com/LLNL/conduit/tree/v0.2.1)
* Boost python and boost interprocess v1.64.0
* Python 2.7.13
* CMake 3.8.2 (or above)
* gcc 5.3 (or above)


### Compiling the Library

* In a teminal, `cd to `niv`'s root directory

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. \
  -DCONDUIT_DIR=<conduit install dir> \
  -DBOOST_ROOT=<boost install dir> \
  -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=<python include directory> \
  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=<absolute path to python library>
make
```

### Compiling the Custom Nest Simulator

These are hints for compiling nest (not included in this repository).

* In a terminal, `cd` to nest's root directory

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../.. \
  -Dwith-conduit=<conduit install dir> \
  -Dniv_DIR=<niv's build directory> \
  -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=<python include directory> \
  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=<absolute path to python library> \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<path to nest's install directory>
make
make install
```


### Generating the Demo Runners

* In a teminal, `cd to `niv`'s root directory

```
cd build
cmake . -DNEST_DIR=<path to nest's install directory>
chmod +x chmod +x demo/nest_python_vis/*.sh
```


## Running the Demo

You'll need two terminals.

* in both, `cd` to `<niv's build directory>/demo/nest_python_vis`

* in the first

```
./run_vis.sh
```

* in the second

```
./run_sim.sh
```

* in the visualization app press "Start"
* in the simulation app press "nest.Simulate(20)"


## Releasing Shared Memory if Something Breaks

If one of the two apps crashes, shared memory might still exist. Consequently, the visualization will throw an exception. In order to manually release the shared memory:

* in a terminal `cd` to `niv`s build directory

```
niv/helper_apps/niv-shared-memory destroy
```
